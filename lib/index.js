/**
* dsh-auto-shutdown — shut the DSH instance down once the web UI stays
* disconnected past a short grace period (5s by default, enough to cover a
* tab reload or a brief machine sleep). Zero-dependency host plugin: no
* imports, so it loads from any installation location (live link, copy,
* hoisted store) without peer-resolution issues.
*
* Presence signal: every browser page keeps one WebSocket mux open at
* /api/remote.mux (dsh-api-gateway) and pumps the $events logical stream for
* the whole page lifetime. The host TypertGatewayService registers one entry
* in ctx.typertGateway.remoteEventClients per live $events stream; the entry goes
* away when that stream ends. A size of 0 does NOT mean "no UI page is connected":
* the map is cleared wholesale when the forwarded event source is deregistered or
* errors out, and non-browser clients sharing the same carrier also count.
*
* Shutdown channel: the launcher provides ctx.appExit, which is
* createProcessShutdown().shutdown(code) under the hood (dsh/lib/profile-boot):
* it arms a 5s force-exit timer and disposes the whole tree; when dispose
* succeeds it clears that timer and only sets process.exitCode — the process
* then exits solely when the event loop drains, which nothing guarantees.
* This plugin therefore schedules its own unref()'d process.exit(0) fallback
* (FALLBACK_EXIT_MS) right after calling appExit(0), so a successfully
* disposed tree cannot linger forever.
* @module dsh-auto-shutdown
